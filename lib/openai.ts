      Example format:
      **Limited Real-Time Data Integration**
      While existing pipelines capture transactional data, most are batch-based, limiting the organization's ability to offer dynamic pricing, real-time fraud detection, or instant product recommendations. Delays in data ingestion reduce the effectiveness of AI models that rely on continuous updates.
      
      **Weak Data Lineage Tracking & Transparency**
      The organization lacks comprehensive tools to trace how data moves from capture to consumption within AI models. Without a clear view of data origins, transformations, and usage, it is difficult to maintain model interpretability.
